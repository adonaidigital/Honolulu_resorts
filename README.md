## Description

A neighborhood map pointing out 7 places of interest in Honolulu, Hawaii. A click on each marker displays associated info to it and a dynamic filter is available to choose a specific place.
This is the final project for [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com/) Front-End Nanodegree (FEND) Program.
I did not set up billing with Google so the map displays a "For development purposes only" watermark. it still works fine.

The project was built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It features responsiveness, accessibility and the offline-first approach.

Two major resources used in addition to the tutorials in the classroom includes [this walkthrough by Edoh Kodjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9t1xxypdkrE&feature=youtu.be) on how to use [Google-Maps-React](https://github.com/fullstackreact/google-maps-react) to integrate Google Maps API with React and the [Google Maps Javascript API Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial).
